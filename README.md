<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
Hey.. this is a protocol implementation of websocket based on the nodejs module http. The main aim of of this project was to show how protocols work and how descriptions on protocol implementations can be implemented into an actual script. While I tried to implement the protoco as widely as i could, the actual protocol itself leaves a of room for addition of extra features and extra protocols.
So feel free to take the script and add your own stuff. I annotated it like hell.. I think a  bit too much, but it should be good enough to explain the flow.
